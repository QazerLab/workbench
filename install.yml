    # Though Vim is _obviously_ much more "basic" than development tools,
    # its plugins and configurations have too many dependencies on development
    # tools and runtimes, which could become a problem when we need not only Vim
    # itself, but also a handful of development plugins for it.
    #
    # To resolve this, let's install Vim a bit later that it should be installed.
    # If development tools are not installed, Vim will still go directly after other
    # base packages, but if they are, Vim will be installed when the environment is
    # ready for building and running the appropriate plugins.
