# This is intentionally: we want to keep roles grouped in subdirectories
# for clarity, but Ansible does not allow it by default when it uses
# roles autodiscovery.
#
# Flattening the roles/ directory structure to satisfy role-name[path]
# requirements and import by role names instead of exact paths is possible,
# but undesired.
#
# There are two options, thus:
#
# * make roles path include all intermediate dirs in roles/;
# * just use direct include by path contrary to best practices.
#
# We choose latter. If inclusion by path will be deprecated and removed,
# there always is an option to just flatten the roles/ hierarchy, though.

# This one is discussable, but given that most of use cases are
# desktop installations (and even server use cases do not imply
# mission-critical environments), comfort matters more than strict
# playbook idempotency.
#
# Should we need to configure Vim on mission-critical servers, this
# one should change and exact tags should be used.
