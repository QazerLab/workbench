vim
===

Installs vim with minimal set of configuration files, which are useful both at desktop
and server machines. Currently includes:

* basic vim configuration (`.vimrc`);
* plugins manager (pathogen) and configuration drop-in directory;
* basic vim plugins and their configurations.

Toolchains may install their own tools and configuration drop-ins to enrich Vim configuration.
