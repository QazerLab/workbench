# Given that all RedHat-family distros already ship the configuration for
# crb and we only need to enable it (not configure it from scratch),
# yum_repository's requirements are a pointless obstacle, so we resort to the
# CLI command to enable the required repo and to avoid per-distro
# configuration.
