# XXX: the yum_repository builtin module requires us to set baseurl or
# mirrorlist parameter explicitly. These URLs are distro-specific, and setting
# them explicitly would require us to customize the installation per-distro
# rather than per- family.
#
# Given that all RedHat-family distros already ship the configuration for
# powertools and we only need to enable it (not configure it from scratch),
# yum_repository's requirements are a pointless obstacle, so we resort to the
# CLI command to enable the required repo and to avoid per-distro
# configuration.
